# Scion and sustainability

This document aims to figure out if there are problems with Scion in terms of it's sustainability claims

ie. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/03/internet-carbon-emissions-data-path-scion/

# Concerns

   * For SCION to work, more machinery would need to be added to the Internet, which is at odds with reducing the ecological (materials, energy) footprint of the Internet
   * SCION gives a path-selection capability, ie. given path A and path B, which path should I take if I wanted the path to be green. What this fails to acknowledge is that even if one of the paths is selected, the other path would still consume energy under current Internet conditions, because all lasers that make both paths usable will still use the same amount of energy, regardless of if an end-point uses one path or the other. (fibre based Internet connections use energy based on capacity, not on if they are actually used).
